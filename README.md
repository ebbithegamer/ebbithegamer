## Hey there, I'm Ebbi!

Who am I? Well, I'm just the average video game addict who just so happens to like programming!

### Currently Working On:

- **[Blue Blur and More](http://blueblurandmore.rf.gd/scripts/index_mockup.php):** A testing website to see what I can make using PHP, JS, etc.
- **[Ebbi's Site O' Fun!](https://ebbiisback.neocities.org):** My personal website that has epik stuff!!

I have a few other projects, but those are *secrets*!

### Update Frequency:

I usually update my projects a few times every month. I'd like to start working on them bi-weekly, so expect changes (that is, if I'm not lazy).

### Contact Me (or stalk me, your choice):
