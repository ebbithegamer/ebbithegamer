## Hey there, I'm Ebbi!

Who am I? Well, I'm just the average video game addict who just so happens to like programming!

### Currently Working On:

- **[RSL-API](https://github.com/ebbithegamer/RSL-API):** An API for the old Roblox revival RSL.
- **[Radblox (Hiatus)](https://radbloxx.000webhostapp.com):** An old Roblox revival currently on hiatus.
- **[Ebbi's Site O' Fun!](https://ebbiisback.neocities.org):** My personal website that has epik stuff!!

I have a few other projects, but those are *secrets*!

### Update Frequency:

I usually update my projects a few times every month. I'd like to start working on them bi-weekly, so expect changes (that is, if I'm not lazy).

### Contact Me (or stalk me, your choice):
