## Hey there!
Who am I? Well, online, I go by the name Ebbi.
I'm just the average video game addict who just so happens to like programming!

I'm currently working on:
  - [RSL-API](https://github.com/ebbithegamer/RSL-API)
  - [Radblox (Hiatus)](https://radbloxx.000webhostapp.com)
  - [Ebbi's Site O' Fun!](https://ebbiisback.neocities.org)

I have a few other projects, but those are *secrets*!
I have a [really epic blog that you should ***TOTALLY*** check out!](https://ebbiisback.tumblr.com/)
Want to get in touch with me? Send an email to ebbithegamer@gmail.com!
